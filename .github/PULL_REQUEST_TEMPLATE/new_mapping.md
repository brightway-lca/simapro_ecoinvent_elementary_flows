# Add new mapping data

Thanks a lot for submitting new mapping data!

Please check that you have done the following:

- [ ] Check to make sure that the flow mappings have the same unit (the `Unit` label should be the same, or should refer to the same thing)
- [ ] If the units aren't the same, then provide a `ConversionFactor`
- [ ] Fix the SimaPro sub-`Context` as appropriate
